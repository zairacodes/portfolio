## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/): v21.7.2 or above

### Installing

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zairacodes/portfolio.git
   cd portfolio
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install

3. **Set up EmailJS (optional)**:  
   If you want to enable the contact form to receive messages directly to your preferred email address:

   - Create a free account on [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
   - Create an `.env` file in the root of your project. Ensure this file is added to your `.gitignore` to keep your credentials safe
   - Add the following variables to your `.env` file, replacing the placeholders with your actual EmailJS service ID, template ID and public key:

   ```bash
    VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id_here
    VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id_here
    VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the development environment**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
